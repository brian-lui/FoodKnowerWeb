# FoodKnower Website — TODO

## Assets Needed
- [ ] Replace phone mockup placeholders with real screenshots (scan in action, score results, nutrition breakdown, scan history, share card)

## Links to Update
- [ ] Update Play Store link once published (currently `#` with "Coming Soon" badge)

## GitHub Pages Setup
- [ ] Go to repo on GitHub → Settings → Pages
- [ ] Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
- [ ] Set branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`, click Save
- [ ] Wait a few minutes — site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/FoodKnowerWeb/`

## Custom Domain (foodknower.com)
- [ ] Wait for DNS to propagate (can take up to 24–48 hours)
- [ ] Back in GitHub Pages settings, check **Enforce HTTPS** once it becomes available
- [ ] Verify site loads at `https://foodknower.com`

## Optional / Future
- [ ] Add Founder's Message section to landing page
- [ ] Add EXIF/metadata stripping confirmation to privacy policy security section

## Text
- [ ] Change the chevron text

## Web Elements Roadmap

### High Impact, Low Effort
- [ ] Add Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `twitter:card`, etc.) — requires a 1200x630px share image asset
- [ ] Replace `#` store badge links with real store URLs when available

### Trust and Clarity
- [ ] Add FAQ section with common questions
  - [ ] "What if one score is low and the other is high? What does that mean?"
  - [ ] "Does this mean I shouldn't eat anything that's bad?"
  - [ ] "Will you provide a journal or calorie counting features?"
  - [ ] "What if the food identification gets the wrong thing?"

### SEO and Indexing
- [ ] Add structured data — MobileApplication schema (requires live Play Store URL)

### Platform and Compliance
- [ ] Add iOS smart app banner (`apple-itunes-app`) if deep-linking later
